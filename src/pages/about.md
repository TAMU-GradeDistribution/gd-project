    <h3>About the GDProject</h3>
  </div>

  Many universities release statistics about how their students faired in their courses.
  This information is extremely useful for students to make informed decisions about their future courses and professors.

  Unfortunately, this data is often difficult to find or understand.
  Universities tend to release this data in formats such as CSVs and plain PDFs which are hard to analyze.

  The GDProject aims to make all of this data more accessible.
  We do this by providing a centralized location, analysis tools, and a simple but powerful interface to explore it.

  No longer shall you run the risk of unknowingly taking a course with a bad professor!

  Check out the [GDProject on GitHub](https://github.com/GDProject) for more details or reach out to us by email [here](mailto:gdproject@adibarra.com).

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
  </div>

  <span class="font-900">First</span>, we go to each of the supported/implemented university websites to get a list of all currently available data.
  We then sift through these links to find any new data that we haven't already processed.
  If we discover any new data we add it to a list.
  Once this is done for each website then proceed to the next step.

  <span class="font-900">Second</span>, the list of data is then gone through and each piece of data is downloaded.
  Once all of the data has been downloaded we then proceed to the next step.

  <span class="font-900">Finally</span>, all of the freshly downloaded data is processed and transformed into the format used by the database.
  All of the data is then added to the database and can instantly be accessed through this website.
