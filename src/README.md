# Features and plugins

## Icons

You can use icons from almost any icon set. Available sets are those from Iconfiy and can be seen [here](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/).

Using `<div i-carbon-home />` will render the home icon from the Carbon icon set.

Only the icons you use will be bundled. Check out [unplugin-icons](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-icons) for more details.
